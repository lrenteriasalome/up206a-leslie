## About Me
*Lupe Renteria Salome, She/her/Ella*

Although my first name is Leslie, I prefer to go by Lupe, short for my second name. I am from the lands of Acapulco, Guerrero in Mexico, and raised in Kumeyaay territory (San Diego, California). I bring with me my professional experience includes designing and developing youth-centered programs and consulting on how to better integrate youth voice in organizations’ strategic planning. 

## Description of the course 
The goal for this course is to expose students to the foundations of spatial data science. The class is structured with introduction to various data science tools, review of the basics of programming with Python and spatial analysis through Python Libraries, and subsequently, through advanced geoprocessing.  All lessons will be based on “real” data with analytical methods addressing relevant and contemporary urban problems. At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to critically describe, analyze, and visualize spatial data for planning practices and research.
## Project ideas
I am interested in the following topics that center community voice and experiences

**Mapping Indigenous communities in California or LA**

**Native herb accessbility for immigrant communities in California**

## Objectives for the class
My objectives for the course are to:

1. Learn foundational knowledge to code with Python

2. Practice creating maps and other visualizations

3. Deepen my understanding in spatial data analysis
